	Long: `A CLI to control the relays connected through a Microcontroller running the Norn firmware.

The norn CLI can be used to test the connection to the device and can also act
as a server which works as a proxy to the relays.

The recommended way of controlling the switches is by using the norn-client.
This handles concurrent access and can also be used on a gateway PC.

Note:
  In a setup with multiple serial devices, it might come in handy to predefine the 
  environment variable NORN_SERIAL_PORT, so the serial port does not need to be 
  provided for every call of the CLI.

Environment Variables:
  NORN_SERIAL_PORT: Defines the default serial port to be used.
